# Book Genre Classification

In this project, we perform an exploratory data analysis on a [book genre prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/athu1105/book-genre-prediction).
We then compare three different models, and tune hyperparameters on the best performing of the three, ultimately resulting in an accuracy of 0.689.

All of the code is contained in Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory. Each of the notebooks also containis extensive prose documenting goals, reasoning, and functionality of the code.

### Key Python libraries
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`
- `nltk`
